# Lisa Development Guide

## Command-Driven AI Guidance

Lisa commands return structured AI guidance that tells the AI what to do next. The pattern:

1. **Show available commands** based on current state
2. **Let the command output drive behavior** - don't hardcode flows in skills
3. **Ask the user what they want to do** when multiple options exist
